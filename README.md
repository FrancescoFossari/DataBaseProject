# DataBaseProject
This project focuses on the management of a dog shelter, addressing all its key aspects. Each dog within the shelter, once captured by a catcher, will be assigned a unique microchip (if the dog is at least one year old), linked to its data, and provided with a booklet containing its personal information. This booklet will be issued by a veterinarian, whose essential details are also recorded. The veterinarian will administer the necessary vaccinations and may also provide occasional medical care if the dog falls ill. The project also includes the management of worker data, which is divided into catchers and staff. All workers are identified by badges and must be of legal age to be included. Catchers may hold one or more licenses, while shelter staff will have fixed working hours and specific duties within the shelter. Additionally, an inventory system for food, purchased from various suppliers, will be maintained to track expenses and costs. Finally, dogs can be adopted by legal adults, who can reserve a dog through adoption records and personal information. Unfortunately, not all dogs are adopted, and some may die within the shelter. To address this, a death certificate entity has been implemented, which records the date and cause of death, helping to monitor the shelterâ€™s mortality rate and the hygiene conditions that may contribute to premature deaths.
